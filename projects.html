In this way, even if players have completed the game, they still will have something to improve themselves. <br><br>

- Categories for different skills <br>
- Multiple levels in each category <br>

- Repeatable, self-improvable scenarios <br>
- Score system <br>
- Google Play Game Services (user sign in, achievements, leaderboards, cloud save) <br>
