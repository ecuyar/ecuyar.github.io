<b>Scope</b><br><br>
We provide a mobile game for android that tests players skills in various ways such as speed, memory, caution, intelligence. Unlike the other puzzle games that contain only one category to play, our game will have different categories for each skill. It will also contain repeatable scenarios like typing test, tap frequency, visual memory, word retrieval. In this way, even if players have completed the game, they still will have something to improve themselves. <br><br>

The game will be available for all devices that supports android 4.0 or higher. It will have an interface that allows to see other player's activities. The game will have standard capabilities such as : <br><br>

- Categories for different skills <br>
- Multiple levels in each category <br>
- Time limited levels <br>
- Repeatable, self-improvable scenarios <br>
- Score system <br>
- Google Play Game Services (user sign in, achievements, leaderboards, cloud save) <br>
- Multiple language support <br>
- ASO (Application Search Optimization) to find the game easily when searched in Play Store <br><br>

The game aims to improve the memory and reflex of players. So that they can use their skills in anywhere in their life. </p>

<b>Requirements</b><br><br>
<b>System Requirements<br>

a. Functional Requirements<br>
- Includes an intellectual scenario with multiple levels.<br>
- Levels will be sorted from easy to hard in intellectual scenario.<br>
- Includes repeatable scenarios like typing test, tapping test, word memory, visual memory.<br>
- A timer will count the time spent in the level.<br>
- When the given time is up, the level will end.<br>
- A certain amount of time will be given for each level.<br>

- Leaderboards will show the global score.<br>
- Cloud save will allow to play the game with different accounts.<br><br>

b. Non-functional Requirements<br>
1) Performance<br>
We will build the game in Unity, which is one of the best 2D game engines. Our game will be optimized for scripts, garbage collector and graphic rendering after building the raw game. These conditions will provide high performance for our users.<br>
2) Scalability<br>
Our game will be accesible for all Play Store users. There is no user limitation to play the game, so scalability of the system will be high.<br>
3) Security<br>
The other main goal of our game is protecting user data. So user's progress will be automatically saved in both local device and cloud. Cloud save will allow to load the player's progress when needed in particular cases such as re-installation, device issues etc.<br>
4) Maintainability<br>
Our game runs on mobile and tablet side. This system will be written in Unity with Android SDK tools and C#. The game will always updated and debugged according to the user's feedback and other new features.<br>
5) Usability<br>
Our game will be easy for user. The soft graphics and the specified color palette will be designed for not exhaust the user's eyes. A simple game menu (which will support multi-languages) and detailed walkthrough will make it easier for the user to understand game mechanics.<br>
6) Availability<br>
Our game will be available for more than 12000 different devices that supports android 4.0 or higher. Users don't have to connect to internet to play the game. Their in-game progress will be loaded in their google accounts when they connect the internet.<br>
